# ADB-Screencap-Display
My simple alternative to Vysor, Genymobile etc. for Android developers; it enables one to view &amp; control one's Android phone within a Java GUI on your computer over USB.

Requires ADB is added to environment variables and one Android phone is connected over USB with debugging enabled.
